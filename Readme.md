# Why use React
- In React we can create reusable components, like we have to create navbar once and use it an every page of our React Application

- We can use states which means that once we update the variable, it changes across the page.

- we can split our app into multiple components and we can reuse those components.

- `ClassName Why` The most important question is why we used ClassName instead of Class in react , so the answer is because we using Javascript to create a React application so if you use class the react app will consider that it is the oops class it is not the a selector class.

- `UseState` a variable that we can used and we can change while using in DOM

- `{ }` in React we use { } curly braces because where ever we want to include pure Javascript so we need to use curly braces if we can't use it so it will be considered as a html content.

- `App.js` App.js in React is the main component that is showing when you just run the React Application.

- `Component` In React a component can be anything that is showing on the React Application like a component can be navbar or a card a component can be a footer etc.

- `Props` Props is like passing data from one component to other
